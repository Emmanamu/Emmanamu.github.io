  <h2>Newsletter End of First Term 2019</h2>
  <p>Keyworkers have been making appointments for discussions with
you all individually around how well the children have settled and
what activities they are interested and involved in. Learning
priorities have been identified and the “next steps” in children’s
learning agreed together. Next steps are a good way to show
specific progress that the children make within a specific area of
their learning. Although we know it is impossible to set next steps
in all aspects of children’s learning we can track a “learning journey” 
for some aspects that seem most relevant and important.
Children now have their ‘Records of Achievement’. We aim to
involve the children in thinking about their own learning and how it
is successful for them. Through this our intention is to strengthen
children’s understanding of how they learn best and support them
in their confidence and enthusiasm as independent learners.
Please continue to share with your keyworker any highlights in the
children’s progress and achievements and add to their folder.
